    This app allows you to register a <strong>.eth</strong> domain name for use in ethereum decentralized applications (dapps) and compatible blockchain browsers. Names are not purchased. Each name registered requires depositing some amount of ether directly into its respective registrar contract for a minimum duration of one year, thus no central entity receives the funds. All ether deposited to contract deeds are then temporarily locked until the end of the auction.

  </p>        
  <p>
    The registration process begins with an auction in which bids are placed for a name. There are three possible outcomes for bidders:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
        During the designated “reveal” period, your bid is revealed to be the highest one and you win the auction. In this case, a deposit equivalent to the value of the second highest bid will be used to secure your name, and the remainder is returned to you :-)
        </li>
        <li>
        During the designated “reveal” period, you reveal your bid, but you are not the highest bidder so you do not win the auction. In this case, your entire deposit will be returned to you, minus a 0.5% fee that is burned :-/
        </li>
        <li>
        If for any reason you failed to reveal your bid during the designated “reveal” period, your entire deposit is burned :-(
        </li> 
    </ol>

    <p>
    Once a name is requested, a period of 120 hours begins, in which anyone can put a sealed bid for it and send the necessary funds (minimum of 0.01 ether). This period is followed by a 48 hour one, in which bids must be revealed. Any bid that is not revealed during this time results in the loss of its related funds. The highest revealed bidder becomes the owner of the name. All ether they sent to the contract will be refunded immediately, minus the value required to outbid the second highest bidder. The remaining funds are kept locked in a contract for at least a year, after which they can be withdrawn by the owner upon releasing ownership of the name. Names with owners are controlled only by their owners, who can transfer or release the name until it needs to be renewed.
    </p>

    <p>
    The registrar contract is expected to be upgraded in 2018 to include small renewal fees, in order to  discourage long-term squatting and speculation.
