  <h1> Backup your bids</h1>

  {{#if bidAmount}}

    <p>Your bids are sealed with a secret to protect their anonymity, so you need that key to reveal. Backing the bids up allows you to restore them in case of data loss. Only the bidding account can reveal it, so make sure that's safe too. <br></p>

  <p><strong> No bids found.</strong> You can still download data that might be used to recover lost bids in the future <br></p>
